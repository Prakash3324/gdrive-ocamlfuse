google\-drive\-ocamlfuse \- FUSE filesystem over Google Drive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
google\-drive\-ocamlfuse [\f[I]options\f[]] [\f[I]mountpoint\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is a FUSE filesystem backed by Google Drive, written in
OCaml.
It lets you mount your Google Drive on Linux.
.PP
The first time, you can run \f[C]google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\f[] without
parameters:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ google\-drive\-ocamlfuse
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This command will create the default application directory
(\f[C]~/.gdfuse/default\f[]), containing the configuration file config.
And it will start a web browser to obtain authorization to access your
Google Drive.
This will let you modify default configuration before mounting the
filesystem.
.PP
Then you can mount the filesystem:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\ mountpoint
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you have more than one account, you can run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\ \-label\ label\ [mountpoint]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Using \f[C]label\f[] to distinguish different accounts.
The program will use the directory \f[C]~/.gdfuse/label\f[] to host
configuration, application state, and file cache.
No file is shared among different accounts, so you can have a different
configuration for each one.
.PP
To get a complete list of options, run
\f[C]google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\ \-help\f[].
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.PP
This application is still under testing, so there are probably bugs to
discover and fix.
To be extra sure, if you want, you can mount the filesystem in
read\-only mode, modifying the configuration (see the documentation), to
avoid any write attempt to the server.
Anyway, the rm command will simply trash your file, so you should always
be able to rollback any changes.
If you have problems, you can turn on debug logging:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\ \-debug\ mountpoint
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In \f[C]~/.gdfuse/default\f[] you can find \f[C]curl.log\f[] that will
track every request to the Google Drive API, and \f[C]gdfuse.log\f[]
that will log FUSE operations and cache management.
If something goes wrong, you can try clearing the cache, with this
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ \ \ \ google\-drive\-ocamlfuse\ \-cc
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If something still doesn\[aq]t work, try starting from scratch removing
everything in \f[C]~/.gdfuse/default\f[].
In this case you will need to reauthorize the application.
.PP
Note that in order to reduce latency, the application will query the
server and check for changes only every 60 seconds (configurable).
So, if you make a change to your documents (server side), you won\[aq]t
see it immediately in the mounted filesystem.
.PP
Note also that, at least for now, Google Documents will be exported
read\-only.
